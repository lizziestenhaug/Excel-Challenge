 Kickstarter Campaigns

Conclusions
About 53% of Kickstarter campaigns are deemed successful
Theatre had the highest number of successful campaigns while journalism had 0 successful campaigns
The United States was responsible for over 70% of the data collected


Limitations of Dataset
We don’t know if there are any outliers in the average donation. For example did one individual pledge $5,000  and 181 individuals pledge $35.
Some timelines are longer than others. For example there are campaigns that only lasted a week vs campaigns that lasted two months.
We don’t know the difference between canceled campaign vs failed campaign
The data set we have per year is off. In 2009 we only have 14 campaigns to go off of (excluding live) while we have 1225 campaigns in 2015.

Possible Tables/Graphs
A graph that shows average $ pledged per category 
A table that compares number of backers to average donation to see if donation amounts are similar if you have for example 100 total backers.  
A table that shows succession, cancelled, and failed rate based on the campaign goal. Do most campaigns fail that have goals of $50,000 and higher?
